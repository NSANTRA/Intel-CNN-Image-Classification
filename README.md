<!-- Project Overview -->
<a id="project-overview"></a>
[![PROJECT OVERVIEW](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=JetBrainsMono+Nerd+Font&letterSpacing=0.3rem&pause=1000&width=400&lines=PROJECT+OVERVIEW)](https://git.io/typing-svg) <br>
This project focuses on developing and evaluating **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for the classification of images from the **Intel Image Dataset**.

The dataset consists of images categorized into six distinct classes:
<br>
üè¢ **Buildings** | üå≤ **Forest** | üèî **Glacier** | ‚õ∞ **Mountain** | üåä **Sea** | üõ£ **Street**

Two different approaches are implemented to assess performance and effectiveness:

1. **CNN Model with Transfer Learning** ‚Äì A model leveraging **VGG19**, a pre-trained deep learning architecture, to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy.
2. **CNN Model Trained from Scratch** ‚Äì A custom-built convolutional neural network trained without any pre-existing weights.

###  **Confusion Matrices**
#### **CNN With Transfer Learning**
![Confusion Matrix](Results/Confusion%20Matrix%20TL.png)
<br>

**Key Observations:**
- ‚úÖ High overall accuracy, fewer misclassifications compared to the second model.
- ‚úÖ Forest category is nearly perfect ‚Äì 468 out of 474 correctly classified.
- ‚úÖ Buildings misclassified mainly as Streets (43 cases) ‚Äì likely due to urban similarities.
- ‚úÖ Glacier vs. Mountain confusion ‚Äì 69 Glacier images misclassified as Mountains.
- ‚úÖ Minimal errors in the Sea category ‚Äì 465 out of 510 correctly classified.

**Major Misclassifications:**
- Glacier mistaken as Mountain (69 cases) ‚Äì Snow-covered landscapes might be confusing.
- Street misclassified as Buildings (43 cases) ‚Äì Similar structures in urban settings.
- Sea occasionally confused with Glacier & Mountain ‚Äì Landscape similarities.

**Takeaway:**
- üî• Transfer Learning improves classification significantly, but Glacier vs. Mountain remains a challenge.

#### **CNN From Sratch**
![Confusion Matrix](Results/Confusion%20Matrix.png)
<br>

**Key Observations:**
- ‚ùå Lower overall accuracy ‚Äì More misclassifications across most categories.
- ‚ùå Glacier category struggles the most ‚Äì 99 Glaciers classified as Mountains (compared to 69 in TL model).
- ‚ùå Buildings misclassified as Streets (67 cases) ‚Äì Worse than Transfer Learning model (43 cases).
- ‚úÖ Forest category still performs well ‚Äì 453 correctly classified out of 474.
- ‚ùå Sea and Mountain confusion is more frequent than in the Transfer Learning model.

**Major Misclassifications:**
- Glacier confused with Mountain (99 cases) ‚Äì Worse than Transfer Learning model.
- Street misclassified as Buildings (41 cases) ‚Äì A bit better than the TL model but still a concern.
- Sea misclassified as Glacier (16 cases) ‚Äì More than in the TL model.

**Takeaway:**
- üö® Training from scratch struggles more, particularly with Glacier-Mountain and Sea-Glacier distinctions. Transfer Learning is clearly more effective for this task.

#### **Summary**
**Key Observations and Comparison**
|Metric                   |Transfer Learning CNN                               |CNN From Scratch                                     |

|**Buildings Accuracy**   |391 correctly classified, 43 misclassified as Street|351 correctly classified, 67 misclassified as Street|
|**Forest Accuracy**      |468 correctly classified, almost no errors          |453 correctly classified, some errors               |
|**Glacier vs. Mountain** |69 Glaciers misclassified as Mountains              |99 Glaciers misclassified as Mountains (worse)      |
|**Sea vs. Mountain**     |Few misclassifications                              |More confusion between Sea and Mountain             |
|**Street vs. Buildings** |Some confusion but better handling                  |More Streets misclassified as Buildings             |

**Key Takeaways**
- ‚úÖ Transfer Learning performs better overall
- ‚úÖ CNN from Scratch struggles more with Glacier & Mountain misclassifications
- ‚úÖ Transfer Learning model has more confident predictions, fewer mixed-up cases
- ‚úÖ Fine-tuning the CNN from Scratch might improve its performance
