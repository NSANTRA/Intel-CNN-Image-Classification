# Intel CNN Image Classification

🌍 Deep Learning Model for Classifying Intel Image Dataset

📌 **Project Overview**

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the Intel Image Classification Dataset. The model is designed to classify images into six categories:

🏔️ Buildings, 🌳 Forests, ⛰️ Glaciers, 🌊 Mountains, 🏝️ Sea, and 🏜️ Streets.

🚀 **Features**

*   📊 **Deep Learning Model:** CNN-based classifier implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
*   🔥 **Transfer Learning:** Uses pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) for improved accuracy.
*   📈 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
*   🏗️ **Modular Code Structure:** Well-organized for easy modification and experimentation.
